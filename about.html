            <h1>What Jude is about</h1>
            <p>
                We will start from the beginning, I was born on July 10th in the city of pittsburgh pa. I grew up about 40 minutes south west of the city, near the West Virginia border, in a small rural town of less than 500 people that was about 15 miles from anything. I ended up graduating 10th in a class of 125 people and continued my education at Penn State University where I studied chemical engineering. After two years of class at PSU I could no longer afford to continue and moved home getting a job as a mechanic and industrial tire technician. In my free time I enjoy riding my motorcyle and the occasional video game. I like to go climbing whenever I can and enjoy just walking through the woods sometimes too.   <br>
